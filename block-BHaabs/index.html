        <p>The flexbox or flexible box model in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces among items to control their alignment structure ie., it is a layout model that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container.CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a CSS 3 web layout model. It is in the W3C's candidate recommendation stage. The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending on viewport size.</p>
      <p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides.</p>   
    <p>The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values.....it's tasty!</p>

    <p>Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other.You can read more about the relationship between flexbox and the Writing Modes specification in a later article; however, the following description should help explain why we do not talk about left and right and top and bottom when we describe the direction that our flex items flow in.</p>
  <p>An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become flex items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave in the following way.The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size.</p>
